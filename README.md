# Employee Reimbursement

## Project Description

Employee Reimbursement provides companies with the tools they need to track and manage reimbursing of employees' company expenditures. Individual employees can login to the site and use submit reimbursement requests specifying how much is due as well as provide a detailed description of the nature of the expense. Financial managers can then simply login and, on a case by case basis, determine what which reimbursements to provide or deny.

Once logged in, a user can view a list of their submitted tickets or create a new ticket by clicking the create ticket button.

After clicking on the Create Ticket button, the user will be taken to a create ticket page. Here the user can enter the cost and category of the expenditure as well as a description.

If a financial manager logs in, they will instead be greeted with a page that lists the user submitted tickets. The manager can filter tickets by status and approve or reject any pending tickets.
